# Zaius React Native SDK

The Zaius React Native SDK module is an NPM package that will allow you to easily interact with the Zaius API via a "Mobile Apps" integration with an app that is written in React Native.

You can get started developing with Zaius with the [Zaius Documentation](https://developer.zaius.com/core-concepts/). This guide will document how to use the Zaius React Native SDK to interact with the Zaius API.
